## Summary

The business could be successful based on the temperature for Oahu, HI. The temperature for both June and December are relatively close. Even though it's December the 
temperature is still warm to continue with surfing and eating ice cream. I would look at the weather dataset to view precipitation for June and December,
this might help with determining which month could be busy. I would also suggest viewing the dataset per quarter rather than twice a year. This would give a better
breakdown of temperature and precipitation and possibly a better idea as to the success of the business.
